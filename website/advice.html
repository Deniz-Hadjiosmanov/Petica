                        at a time. Give small rewards for small feats, big rewards for more difficult tasks. There are
                        so many ways you can show your dog that you're proud of him. Everything from a verbal praise, a
                        hug, or a favourite toy, to a new ball or even a nice massage. Showing your dog pure love and
                        affection will strengthen the bond between you. The important thing about using rewards is to
                        get your dog to respond to you, not to a treat.</div>

                        both mental and physical benefits. To keep your pet from getting bored, find a few activities
                        (such as fetch, hide-and-seek and scent games) that you enjoy playing with each other. Your pet
                        isn’t sure how to play games? Ask someone who does reward-based training how you can teach him.

                        This isn’t just dumping out the old water and putting fresh in. Clean the bowl thoroughly so
                        that the bottom isn’t slimy and there aren’t weird bits of kibble crumb floating around in
                        it.The bowl should be cleaned every day not just cause of all the floaties that come out of your
                        pet’s mouth, but also because of the bacteria that can transfer in there from your dog’s mouth.
