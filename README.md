**What is our Product?**<br>
We made a website called Petica which works as a pet suggestor that recommends a suitable breed of an animal based on questions that the user has to answer.

The way Petica works is as follows: the user chooses an animal that they would like to have and then a quiz with multiple-choice answers starts for this animal. The questions in the quiz are different for the different animals â€“ they are made based on interviews with veterinarians, pet shop owners and potential users of our product. At this point, there are 5 animals that the website can recommend: 
	
- Dog
- Cat
- Fish
- Bird	
- Reptile

After getting a recommendation, the user can go to a map and see what pet shops there are in the vicinity.

**How is our Product Built Up?**<br>
To realize our product Petica, we made use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript.<br>
Our purpose was to keep the code understandable with proper variable names and comments on the necessary places. We coded the whole website from scratch because we wanted to experience our own process of coding and structuring. This is in order to make it easier for us to transfer our work to LiveWall so that they can easily continue working on the product. In order to make our Contact form work we used an API. This is because it already has the functionality which sends the messages.
